                  The Persian cat, also known as the Persian longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by a
                  round face and short muzzle. Compare to other cat breeds they live longer than others. They have long
                  hair but don’t shed much, which means there’s less hair for allergens to cling to. So if you want to
                  take care of a playful cat for a very long time, then you can consider having this cutey.
